## 🌐 Overview

Learn Math Discret is a revolutionary approach to discrete mathematics documentation, breaking away from traditional academic patterns. Through unconventional analogies and cyberpunk-themed examples, complex mathematical concepts are brought into the real world.

## 🎭 Persona

Meet Dr. Trinity Matrix - A rebel mathematician who spent years developing illegal AIs in Neo Tokyo's underground clubs. Now, she's sharing her knowledge through unconventional analogies from the underworld.

## 🚀 Features
